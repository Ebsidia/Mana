# Mana
Mana Engine

Getting Started

Recommend you use Visual Studio 2019, Mana is currently untested on other IDEs.

Start by cloning the repository with git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ebsidia/Mana to make sure all the submodules are loaded.

Mana uses a build system to generate the project using Premake. Once you have cloned the project go to the scripts folder and run the generateWinProject.bat app to build the project.

In the solution explorer you can then select which project you want to view. Right click on the project and then select "set as startup project". This will allow you to view that particular project. You can do this with the Breakout game, Mana-Editor and Sandbox.
