# Mana
Mana Engine

Getting Started

Recommend you use Visual Studio 2019, Mana is currently untested on other IDEs.

Start by cloning the repository with git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ebsidia/Mana to make sure all the submodules are loaded.

Mana uses a build system to generate the project using Premake. Once you have cloned the project go to the scripts folder and run the generateWinProject.bat app to build the project.
